            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>JUST PRINCIPLES Of Complying with the New <hi>Oath of Allegiance.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE New Oath is certainly an intricate caſe, and incumbred with no ſmall difficulties: But it will appear unexceptionably lawful, if (without intermedling with the Politicks of theſe times) we ſuppoſe, that there may be three Parties concern'd in an Oath of Allegiance;</p>
            <q>A Ruining-Prince, A Saviour-Prince, And innocent Subjects.</q>
            <p>The terms of <hi>ruining</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> are ambiguous, and may ſignifie in a lax or ſtrict acceptation; and therefore a Prince may be <hi>ruining</hi> and malificent in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees. He may be ſo far <hi>ruining</hi> and malifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as to <hi>Abdicate his People from being his People;</hi> whereby he loſeth and forfeiteth all Title to them and their Allegiance. <note n="*" place="margin">Grot. de J. B. ac P. l. 1. c. 4. S. XI.</note> 
               <hi>Exiſtimat Barclaius amitti Regnum, ſi Rex vere hoſtili animo in totius populi exitium fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quod concedo; conſiſtere enim ſimul non poſſunt volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas imperandi &amp; voluntas perdendi; quare qui ſe hoſtem
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95317:3"/> totius populi profitetur, is eo ipſo abdicat regnum. If a King maketh Himſelf a Deſtroyer of his whole people, He Abdicateth the Kingdom</hi> (according to <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Barclay) becauſe the Will of deſtroying is inconſiſtent with the Will of being their governing Head.</hi> It is poſſible, that a Bigotted, pontifician Prince may not be in this notion a <hi>ruining Prince;</hi> for although He manifeſtly deſigneth <hi>to ſubvert and extirpate the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and to introduce his own (which every Prince deſireth,) yet He may not deſign to extirpate the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Proteſtants out of his Kingdom. But the World need not be told, that the Principles of his Religion oblige Him to it; And 'tis not probable, that the <hi>French</hi> King's principal Allie would be better natur'd to his Proteſtant Subjects, than his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. The ſinking calamities which He was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually introducing, <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Gallican</hi> Slavery (which have all manner of Evils in the Bowels of them,) as alſo his Combination with the common Enemy of Chriſtendom, ruinous to the State of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Proteſtant Party in <hi>Europe,</hi> may juſtly denominate Him a <hi>ruining Prince</hi> at a Superlative rate.</p>
            <p>The notion of a <hi>Saviour-Prince</hi> uſually occurreth in Hiſtory; as in the inſtances of <hi>Ptolomy, Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Under this notion our preſent King ought to be conſider'd, (which is far more honourable than the ſtyle of a Kind, <hi>de facto,</hi> competible to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vile Uſurper;) nor is He only a Saviour-Prince to theſe Nations, but to haraſs'd, afflicted <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Reformed Churches abroad. A Saviour-Prince may be ſuch before his entrance upon the Government, if with vaſt expence and hazard He becometh our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer from the calamities of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> And being ſeated in the Government, He ſubſiſteth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95317:3"/> in the quality of a Saviour-King. <hi>A man ſhall be an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt; as rivers of water in a dry place; as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>innocent Subjects</hi> I underſtand Subjects uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Revolutions of Government, who cannot be thought under any <hi>Obligatio delicti</hi> to their former King, and who will not fail to judge of all his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>ex aequo &amp; bono.</hi> Subjects are thought incompetent Judges of the Rights of Princes: but they that dare not ſwear Allegiance to an Uſurper againſt their rightful Sovereign, muſt take upon them to make a judgment of his Pretenſions, that calleth himſelf by that venerable name. Having thus repreſented the notion of <hi>Innocent Subjects,</hi> and of <hi>two oppoſite ſorts of Princes,</hi> we may proceed to affirm,</p>
            <p n="1">I. If the main of our Allegiance to a Ruining-Prince, out of poſſeſſion, be ceas'd and expir'd, and the reſt be forfeited by Him, it is lawful to ſwear Allegiance to <hi>the King in poſſeſſion.</hi> The Law determineth our Subjection and Allegiance to the King in poſſeſſion: but the ſame Law (and our Oath alſo) determineth, who it is, that ſhould be, and be continu'd King in poſſeſſion. From whence it followeth, That the Duties of Allegiance (which is the buſineſs of being Liege-Subjects) are of two ſorts: <hi>Bounden Duty to Government,</hi> which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legible in the Law, (<hi>Submiſſion, Obedience, Tribute, Gratitude,</hi> and ſuch more) and <hi>bounden Duty of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Adherence</hi> to the rightful Governour, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd <hi>the King de Jure.</hi> If the rightful Governour was by fraud and violence kept out of poſſeſſion, or unjuſtly thrown out of place, faithful Subjects (in former Ages) ſuppos'd themſelves under an Obligation to this <hi>Jural King.</hi> Which ſuppoſition of theirs was not ill grounded,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95317:4"/> as appeareth from the contexture of the old Oath of Allegiance, from our Obligations to Juſtice, and from the Nature of Fidelity and Friendſhip (for the relation between Sovereign and Subject is a relation of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>amicitiae imparium:</hi>) but to this latter ſort of the Duties of Allegiance, a Ruining-Prince out of place can pretend no Title. If He be kept out of poſſeſſion, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects are not bound to introduce Him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to endeavour his legal Excluſion: or if He be thruſt out of place, they are not bound to adhere to him, own him, reduce him, fight or ſtruggle for him; they owe him nothing, but may entirely forſake him, and be glad that they are rid of him, for (by ſeeking their ruin) He hath juſtly forfeited the Friendſhip of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people (and therefore the fidelity of their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) and all the Offices of Friendſhip, which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe due to a rightful Governour out of place. The other ſort of Duties of Allegiance, <hi>Duties to Government,</hi> the Law transferreth to the King in poſſeſſion, and they are deſervedly given to <hi>a Saviour-King.</hi> If therefore a Ruining-Prince be out of Place and governing Power, the Bond or Relation between Him and his innocent People is entirely diſſolv'd, by a Ceſſation of one part, and a Forfeiture of the other part of their Allegiance, and the whole buſineſs of their Adherence, Fidelity and Allegiance to him is at an end. A faithful Subject will not eaſily forſake a tolerable Prince: but there may be a Prince of ſuch a character, that there is no owning Him, adhering to Him, or ſuffering for Him with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Conſcience. And if He ought to be intirely forſaken by his innocent Subjects, they are not bound to reſerve for Him any Allegiance, nor to make his pretended Rights the matter of their care.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95317:4"/>
            <p n="2">II. There are ſeveral <hi>Total</hi> Modes of deſtroying a King's Right of Regality; and there are ſeveral <hi>Partial</hi> Modes of deſtroying it, approaching to a <hi>Total:</hi> If by this latter ſort of Modes the Competitor-King's Right of Regality be ſufficiently deſtroy'd, innocent Subjects may ſwear Allegiance to the King in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a King hath not alienated or given away his Kingdom, nor thrown it away and abandon'd it, nor hath ſought in an hoſtile way the deſtruction of his whole People, or the Body of them (which are <hi>total Modes</hi> of deſtroying his Right of Regality;) yet if it plainly appeareth, that the kindneſs which he hath for Proteſtants (the Body of his People) and the uſage which He deſigneth them, cannot be much diſſonant from his Neighbours, (<hi>Tell me with whom thou goeſt, and I will tell thee what thou art,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb.) This can be thought nothing leſs than a <hi>partial</hi> Mode of deſtroying his Right of Regality, approaching to a <hi>total.</hi> If a King hath laid a deſign (and manag'd it for ſeveral years) of ruining his People in every thing that is dear to them, in their <hi>Laws, Liberties, Property</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> This alſo muſt be thought a partial Mode of deſtroying his Right of Regality, approaching to a <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> for it approacheth to <hi>an Abdication of his People.</hi> And there is the ſame reaſon <hi>for Abdicating the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Violation of Laws ought not to be aggravated beyond its juſt bounds, no more than Receſſions from the great Rule of Government, the publick good: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heinous Violations of the Laws in ſeveral great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; the aſſuming a Power of Diſpenſing with Laws at pleaſure; and a declared reſolution not to adminiſter the Government according to Law, are an Abdicating the legal Engliſh Government in a great degree; they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95317:5"/> are ſuch Violations of the Coronation-Oath as approach to a nulling the contract between King and People, (whatever that ſignifieth;) And if a Prince affecteth Arbitrarineſs at ſuch a rate, that nothing leſs will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him than the adminiſtring all things according to his own will, (without regard to Oaths, Laws, Property;) if he altereth the whole Species of the Government, or manifeſtly maketh it his deſign to exterminate it, This is a total Abdication of our legal Engliſh Government, and a depoſing that officiary Dignity, the legal Regality. But that the ſtring may not be over-ſtretch'd in any thing, let all that hath been done in the late Reign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſubverſion of our conſtitution, and the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>French</hi> Mode of Government, be thought nothing more, than <hi>a partial deſtroying the Right of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality approaching to a total.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A King may make ſuch a Receſſion from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may be a degree of abandoning the governing of us; and there may be a fair appearance of <hi>a Conqueſt of the King:</hi> For although there was no formal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of War upon the King in the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>'s Diſcent, it ſeem'd not an hoſtile aggreſſion, nor any thing more than a requeſt of Right with the Sword in his hand: yet it muſt be acknowledg'd, that the Prince did expreſly declare War againſt all thoſe that oppos'd his deſigns (which implieth a Declaration of War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King,) the King expreſly declar'd War upon the Prince, and therefore they were in the ſtate of War; the iſſue whereof was the King's removal from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and out of the Kingdom, which carrieth a fair appearance of <hi>a Conqueſt of the King.</hi> A Conqueſt of the King is a Mode of total deſtroying the Right of Regality: But becauſe the Army of Multitudes of the Subjects, and a deſertion of the Souldiery, were compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95317:5"/> with the Prince's Arms, we will ſuppoſe this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Conqueſt of the King, to be nothing more than <hi>a partial deſtroying the Right of Regality approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a total.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a King be ruining at ſuch a rate, that He is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Government as an Idiot or Lunatick; and if a Regency be neceſſary for the ſafety of the Nation, This muſt be thought <hi>a partial deſtroying the Right of Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity approaching to a total.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome Doctrines in the Roman Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of civil Society; ſuch as the principle of <hi>not keeping Faith with Hereticks:</hi> If any King ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly own this principle, it would be totally deſtructive to his Right of Sovereignty in a Proteſtant Kingdom, (for He could have no Right to demand the Faith and Allegiance of the People; nor could He be a capable object of Faith or Credit, nor of Promiſes, Contracts, and Oaths:) if he doth not expreſly avow this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; yet if it be highly probable (from many indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) that He is a Man of that principle, This can be thought nothing leſs than <hi>a partial deſtroying the Right of Regality approaching to a total.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Kings of the Pontifician perſwaſion manage Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at ſuch a rate of Craft and Cruelty, that there is no living for Proteſtant Subjects in Society with ſuch Sovereigns; inſomuch that they have made it matter of diſpute, Whether a Nation of Proteſtants (eſpecially an unenſlav'd Nation) be bound to be Liege-Subjects to Kings of ſuch a character, that keep no Faith with them, obſerve no Rules of Juſtice towards them, ſtick at nothing to deſtroy them, This muſt be thought <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial deſtroying the Right of Regality approaching to a total.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Ruining-King be thrown out of place, this is a total deſtroying his Right of Regality in reſpect of his innocent Liege-Subjects, whoſe Friendſhip and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95317:6"/> he hath juſtly forfeited, as is before diſcours'd: but becauſe theſe are only part of the People, let this be thought nothing more than <hi>a partial deſtroying the Right of Regality approaching to a total.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If upon a Breach between King and People (juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the People's part) the King recedeth, and there be no place for a <hi>tolerable re-coalition,</hi> nor for any <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable projects of Government</hi> conſiſtent with his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, This can be thought nothing leſs than <hi>a partial deſtroying the Right of Regality approaching to a total.</hi> Breaches with the King are not eaſily reconcileable with the Law of God and of the Land, nor with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the riſe of the Reformation, <hi>That 'tis not lawful upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to take Arms againſt the King.</hi> But doubtleſs the Doctrine of due Non-reſiſtance ought to be reſtrain'd to ſuch reſiſtance which is hurtful and deſtructive to the King (agreeably to the uſual ſence of that Political Aphoriſm, <hi>The King can do no wrong,</hi> his Miniſters on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are accountable and puniſhable;) it deſigneth not to abridge the Body of the People of the Right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting an extravagant Prince in caſes of evident and great neceſſity; provided, they contain themſelves within the limits of juſt bounding their Prince, and of juſt Self-defence and Self-ſecurity; for beyond theſe bounds Proteſtants never pretended to proceed in their Oppoſitions to their Princes. But there may be a Prince <hi>not to be bounded</hi> or brought to any thing (which is the general ſence of Wiſe men touching our late King,) the Eſtates of the Realm have adjudg'd, that there was no reducing Him upon terms or conditions, no place for Treaty; they have debated the project of a Regent, and determin'd it impracticable; and that no proviſion could be made for the Government, but by a new Eſtabliſhment and a new Allegiance inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95317:6"/> with any meaſure of his Allegiance, ſuppoſing them to have proceeded upon great Reaſons, and with all imaginable fairneſs and equity; at what a rate hath his late Majeſty deſtroy'd his Right of Regality? For having upon other accounts reduc'd it to multifarious <hi>next to nothings,</hi> He had brought things to ſuch a ſtate upon his Receſſion, that any further adherence to his Allegiance was become impracticable, and all proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Government conſiſtent with that Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. If it be unlawful to comply with the new Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, it muſt be Virtue and Duty to conteſt for ſome other eſtabliſhment, conſiſtent with ſome degree of former Allegiance: but no ſuch Model is yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and probably the <hi>Quadrature</hi> of the Circle is of as eaſie inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral Modes of deſtroying the Right of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality ought to be conſider'd, not only confuſedly and in an heap, but in orderly connexion and ſucceſſion one ought to be ſuper-added to another. An imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Abdication of the Adminiſtration of Government, and an imperfect Conqueſt may be thought ſufficient to extinguiſh ſuch a Right of Regality, that was before dying and expiring: or if ſome little of it ſtill ſeemeth to remain, (yet if the Eſtates of the Realm have judg'd aright, that all former Allegiance was become impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable) this little will be nothing more than ſuch a rigor of Right, that in common Equity is not demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. If upon a full and juſt computation of things it appeareth, That nothing of the People's Subjection and Allegiance is reaſonably and in common Equity demandable by the King out of place, than his Right of Regality muſt be thought ſufficiently deſtroy'd: The Subjects muſt be bound to more than <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> Subjection and Allegiance, if they be bound to ſuch a degree of Allegiance, which cannot in reaſon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95317:7"/> be demanded; ſuch Allegiance is like a pretended Debt, that in common Equity is not demandable, which no man in conſcience is bound to pay, and which He is abſolv'd from before God.</p>
            <p>This Account of things pretendeth not to any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Nation to depoſe the King, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Subjects from their Allegiance, by virtue of our (ancient) Engliſh conſtitution: But it appealeth to common Equity (which is <hi>germana juſtitia</hi>) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the total Non-obligation of innocent Subjects from their Allegiance; which is no more a depoſing the King than a Debtor's Plea of Abſolution in Conſcience from an undemandable debt is a depoſing his Creditor, or than a Servant's Plea of diſcharge from an undemanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service is a depoſing his Maſter.</p>
            <p>III. Suppoſe the Competitor-King's Right of Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be not reduc'd to none; yet if it be reduc'd to next to none, innocent Subjects may ſwear Allegiance to the King in poſſeſſion: For although good Subjects ſuppoſe themſelves under an obligation, to reſerve an Allegiance for an undoubted rightful Governor, yet not for ſuch a Governor that hath either no Right at all, or next to none; for Niceties and Nothings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with mighty Motives and Obligations, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing. If the Competitor-King's Title to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be ſo extremely infirm and invalid, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not create a valid Obligation upon the Subject to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to his Allegiance againſt the King that is in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (perhaps upon tolerable fair terms) the Authority of the Nation, publick Determinations, and all the mighty Intereſts of our Country and Religion.</p>
            <p>IV. They that ſuppoſe a <hi>Regality</hi> to be juſtly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deſtroy'd, muſt ſuppoſe themſelves diſcharg'd from its Allegiance, and that they may confederate a new Allegiance; for it cannot be ſaid without a contradiction,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95317:7"/> that a <hi>Regality juſtly and neceſſarily deſtroy'd, retaineth the Right of Government, and ought to ſubſiſt.</hi> Some Ruining-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities ought to be bounded only, and reduc'd to reaſon; others ought to be demoliſh'd, both upon the account of their vaſt Maleficence to their Subject-Nations, and becauſe the Intereſt of the whole neceſſarily requireth it; which is the caſe of the late Regality, <hi>A branch of a certain reigning Power and Intereſt, ruinous to the Nation and to the whole.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Philo. Opuſc. p. 158.</note> 
               <hi>No Artificer maketh the whole for a part, but the part for the whole;</hi> and if the part be for the whole, it is Juſtice and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deſtroy a part, as Phyſicians do, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <hi>for the neceſſary conſervation of the whole.</hi> It is Juſtice and Duty to demoliſh that part of a City whoſe ſtanding is deſtructive to the whole (it ought not to ſubſiſt;) no wrong or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is done to any, if a part be demoliſh'd, when the ſafety and intereſt of the whole neceſſarily requireth it; for every part and its Rights are for the whole. On the contrary, it would be monſtrouſly unjuſt and uncharitable, to uphold a Cock-loft to the ruin of the whole Houſe, and to preſerve a Cabin to the ſinking a Ship. The beſt Account of our late Revolution and change of Government is, <hi>Duty to the whole,</hi> (which in our caſe is <hi>Europe,</hi> more eſpecially <hi>Reformed Chriſtendom,) and the ſafety thereof neceſſarily requir'd it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a great ſtranger to the World, who knoweth not, that of late years there hath been in the World a reigning Power and Intereſt (the <hi>French</hi>-Papal) ruinous to the whole in all its branches; and that the redemption of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the Proteſtant Party in <hi>Europe,</hi> from the reigning and ruining Power and Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> and its Allies, is vaſtly juſt and neceſſary. If this Nation had continu'd ſubject to that ruining Power and Intereſt, ſuch a poſture would have been ruinous to the reſt of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (being imploy'd to ſerve the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt) which is no tolerable poſture of humane affairs. As a branch of that reigning Intereſt, and becauſe its ſtanding is ruinous
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95317:8"/> to the whole, the late Regality (like an Houſe infected with a fretting Leproſie) ought to be demoliſh'd.</p>
            <p>But although it ought to be demoliſh'd, yet not in the method of popular Fury (by Subjects taking Arms to depoſe or deſtroy their King, and then abſolving themſelves from their Allegiance) the Chriſtian Religion and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Profeſſion, <hi>Nil niſi juſtum ſuadet &amp; lene:</hi> but a juſt method will appear in this following Hypotheſis. In the late Expedition of our generous Prince, there was a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Deſign and Undertaking, complicate and conjunct, yet of ſeparate and diſtinct conſideration; the one reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>the whole,</hi> the other <hi>a part;</hi> the one was <hi>oppoſitive</hi> to that reigning Power and Intereſt, ruinous to the whole: the other was <hi>redreſſive</hi> of the Grievances of the Engliſh Nation. If in order to the firſt deſign, the Citizens of the whole (the Eſtates of <hi>Europe</hi>) combine; if one of their number (an Independent Prince) becometh a kind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Redeemer to the ſinking eſtate of Chriſtendom, and undertaketh a deſign (either by the calmer or ſeverer methods) to break the Power and Intereſt of the common Enemy of Chriſtendom in this Nation; if in his juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition He proceedeth to a removal of his late Majeſty, and his Heir, of the <hi>French</hi>-Papal Intereſt (if he had any) from the Government and Kingdom, there can be nothing unjuſt in this method of demoliſhing the <hi>Regality;</hi> nor is it unjuſt, if good Subjects ſuffer it to be demoliſhed (both becauſe of their own danger and their paramount obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole;) nor is it unjuſt, if the Eſtates of the Realm add an <hi>Epicriſis,</hi> that his late Majeſty's removal from the Government was (in this notion) juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. It is certain, that his removal from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though his Receſſion was not altogether forc'd and involuntary) was the effect of the Prince's Arms <note n="*" place="margin">Driven out of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Letter to a Biſhop, <hi>p. 21, 22.</hi>
               </note>, and of his Conduct of affairs, and ought chiefly to be aſcrib'd thereunto; And that in an Exigence of the whole, a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95317:8"/> Saviour-Prince may reaſonably proceed to ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, (whereas if a Nation only be in danger of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution from their King, their Saviour-Princes uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further than to divert the preſent ſtorm;) And if a Saviour-Prince <hi>juſtly and neceſſarily</hi> proceedeth to ſo great an extremity, the Nation is diſcharg'd from their former Allegiance; the Right of Government belongeth no more to his late Majeſty, or his (pretended) Heir of the <hi>French</hi> Papal Intereſt, but our Subjection and Allegiance to that line of Succeſſion is at an end. Which if the Nation be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd from, they neceſſarily become <hi>a free people (ſui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris)</hi> if the next Heirs will make them ſuch, and <hi>the Crown becometh vacant.</hi> The Revolution in this Nation is a Caſe of the whole, and the Act of the Citizens of the whole. A Tranſcendental to Civil and Municipal Law, but not the leſs lawful for being ſo.</p>
            <p>There was a ſecond Deſign, co-incident in time, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and complicate with the former, (part of it, as the Nation is part of the whole, but of ſeparate conſideration from it) <hi>peculiarly redreſſive of the Grievances of the Engliſh Nation.</hi> Multitudes of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation (intent upon the ſaving their own Free-hold) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd a Neighbour-Prince, to come to their reſcue from an Hurricane of Popery and Arbitrary Power, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the tottering Fabrick of their Government; they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him by Aſſociations and Arms, both Subjects and Souldiers made a defection from the late King, which iſſu'd in his Receſſion from the Kingdom, and a Vote of the Convention of the Eſtates abſolving the Nation from their Allegiance. If this Scene of affairs be conſider'd as one continu'd Deſign to demoliſh the late Regality, it is not juſtifiable by Engliſh Law or Engliſh Divinity (It is all one, whether the People demoliſh the Regality by their own or another's hand:) But this Scene of affairs ought to be diſtinguiſh'd into three periods of time; the Time before
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95317:9"/> the Breach, the Time of the Breach between King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Time after it. The Time before the Breach neceſſitated an Addreſs to a Neighbour-Prince, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, and Laws, the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects from a violent Rape. During the Time of the Breach, the Affairs of the Kingdom were in ſuſpence, and therefore the Breach may be conſider'd as nothing more than a juſt and neceſſary Self-defence. In the third period of Time, the Eſtates of the Realm delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate touching the remainder of Duty to their with-drawn King, and proceed to a definitive Sentence, <hi>That He had Abdicated the Government, and the Crown was become vacant.</hi> To make the Juſtice of this definitive Sentence appear, part of it, (the vacating the Crown) ought to be conſider'd, not in a ſeparate and ſolitary notion; but as the late Deſign <hi>redreſſive of the Grievances of the Nation</hi> was concurrent with another Deſign <hi>oppoſitive</hi> to that reigning Power and Intereſt ruinous to the whole: So I underſtand this part of the definitive Sentence, only as a <hi>concurrence</hi> with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Mode of <hi>vacating the Crown;</hi> and in ſuch a notion it is neceſſarily juſt, becauſe the former Mode is certainly ſo. With the former Mode of demoliſhing the Regality, there was alſo a concurrence of his late Majeſty's <hi>will to be gone;</hi> and his Mode of Receſſion (leaving no Commiſſioner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the Seals, deſtroying the Writs for a Parliament) is neceſſarily a Degree of Abandoning the governing of us. If this Degree of Abandoning the Government be conſider'd with its Antecedents (ſubverting the Conſtitution, viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Fundamental Laws, deſigning his People's ruin, and ſuch more) and alſo with its Conſequent (that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion can be made for the Government conſiſtent with his Allegiance,) the Sum-total is ſuppos'd to amount to thus much, <hi>No further Subjection or Allegiance is in equity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable</hi> from the People: And if no further Subjection or Allegiance of the People be in Equity demandable by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95317:9"/> the King, <hi>He hath Abdicated the Government.</hi> In this notion the late Revolution is of a better appearance than uſually changes of Government are: But we will ſuppoſe, that in this notion it is not abſolutely juſt; yet becauſe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer notion, and as to innocent Subjects it is unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly juſt, therefore a good Man may be rationally ſatisfy'd, that <hi>the late Regality is juſtly and neceſſarily demoliſh'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. The King in poſſeſſion (upon ſeveral accounts) may juſtly demand the Allegiance of the People; not upon the account of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> for there is no pretence to the Conqueſt of the People; the contract alſo between the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Nation (which we are <note n="*" place="margin">Letter to a Biſhop, <hi>p. 22.</hi>
               </note> told of) ought to protect the People from any ſuch claim; and altho' his Majeſty may be ſaid to have conquer'd our late King, yet not at all as a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conqueror,</hi> conteſting for <hi>Dominion</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> but as a Saviour-Prince to the Nation and to the whole; agreeably to the ſtyle of his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and his publick Profeſſion, that <hi>He came not hither for any Intereſt, but to ſave us from Popiſh ſlavery.</hi> Firſt therefore his Majeſty is juſtly ſaid to have a degree of Propriety in the People by <hi>Right of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> (having done enough to Merit the Name of a Redeemer of the People) according to the known Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gratitude, which is the main ſource of our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A ruin'd People (actually ruin'd in part, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for further degrees of ruin) <hi>owe themſelves to him,</hi> and their former Sovereign deſerveth to loſe them for ever to a Saviour Prince, having manifeſtly deſign'd to make them extremely miſerable. In the next place, becauſe of his juſt Propriety in the People, and becauſe of the vaſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence of his Government (which obligeth to the Duties of Gratitude) a Saviour-Prince in poſſeſſion hath a better Right to the People's Allegiance, than a Natural-unnatural Prince out of place, that hath reduc'd his Right to none, or next to none; and therefore in caſe of competition, the former is <hi>rather the rightful King.</hi> So if an Heir of the <hi>French</hi>-Papal Intereſt, (not fairly and legally aſcertain'd to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95317:10"/> the Nation) come in competition with the Queen, it is a known rule of the Caſuiſts, <hi>In rebus dubiis melior eſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio poſſidentis.</hi> Moreover, if the Nation, or the major part of it, be fairly diſoblig'd from their former Allegiance, our preſent King is in the Government by an unexceptionable Right, the Election of a free People. His Majeſty hath alſo an higher Title than any national Law-Title, and is King by an higher Law, (that which is in it ſelf Law:) for in a grand Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the whole (the greateſt that ever was) He is in the Government upon the ſcore of <hi>a juſt and neceſſary Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of us and of <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore ought to be in the Government. A Saviour-Prince in the Government, upon the ſcore of <hi>a juſt and neceſſary Redemption of us and of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> is the moſt deſirable thing in this World, and is next door to infinitely juſt and neceſſary: All pretenſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to National Law-Titles, ought to lay themſelves at the feet of his Paramount-Title. And as the late Reign was not for the main a lawful, civil Government (in reſpect of the Adminiſtration,) but a branch of that reigning Power and Intereſt which is ruinous to us and to the whole: So we confederate Allegiance with our preſent King, not only as with a lawful King in reſpect of his Adminiſtration (who is to govern us by Law,) but as with a Saviour-Prince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us and to the whole.</p>
            <p>VI. Innocent Subjects, that by the fault of their own Ruining-Prince, are neceſſitated to crave and live under the Protection of a Saviour-Prince, either at home or abroad, may and ought to become his Liege-People. For a Saviour-Prince may juſtly demand of all that are neceſſitated, to crave and live under his Protection, that they make Faith and Allegiance to him: thus far Protection and Allegiance are manifeſtly reciprocal, <hi>Accipe beneficium, redde debitum.</hi> Which contract of Allegiance with a new Prince (becauſe it is juſt and neceſſary) is a juſt and neceſſary Abrenunciation of all Allegiance to their former King, which perfectly diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the bond or relation between them. Thus a people
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95317:10"/> perſecuted by their own Prince, betake themſelves uſually to a Foreign Saviour-Prince (without crime or blame) as their ſanctuary and ſhelter, and give up themſelves to his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But whether this be done at home or abroad, whether we go to a Saviour-Prince, or a Saviour-Prince cometh to us, it maketh no alteration in the caſe of innocent Subjects. They may be neceſſitated to crave and live under the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Saviour-Prince at home, to ſhelter them from a reigning Power and Intereſt (ruinous to them and to the whole,) of which their natural Prince is a branch. And they that are rationally ſatisfy'd, that this is indeed their caſe, may conſcientiouſly give up themſelves to a new Allegiance. Which may be done with greater ſatisfaction upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe additional Conſiderations: By complying with the new Oath, we do nothing at home now, but what muſt have been done abroad within a while (perhaps before this time) if his late Majeſty had continu'd in the Government.</p>
            <p>If by a non-compliance with it, Proteſtants ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diviſions, and <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould once more regain the Throne, who ſhall anſwer for the tremendous conſequences? Some ſuppoſe, it was the duty of the <hi>Convention of Eſtates</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves effectually, when Providence gave them an opportunity, and to rid their hands of <hi>Popery</hi> for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the inhumanity which it involveth; if this be doubtful, yet it is paſt doubt, that every good Man will be loath to adviſe or contribute to the re-enthroning it.</p>
            <p>VII. A Ruining-King out of place, cannot be thought King <hi>de jure, when his non-reigning condition muſt be thought,</hi> de jure, <hi>perpetual.</hi> If having before invalidated his own Right, and reduc'd it to nothing, or next to nothing; ſuch a Prince perſevereth (for a conſiderable tract of time, paſt all hope of better) a branch of that Power and intereſt which is ruinous to the Nation and to the whole; It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe him irrecoverably ſuch, and that a non-reigning condition ought to be to him perpetual (for He can have no Right to reign, but in conſiſtence with the ſafety of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95317:11"/> Nation and of the whole;) And if the buſineſs of his reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in point of Right</hi> be at an end, then his innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Allegiance is alſo at an end.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhould ſuppoſe, that his Right is not totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, that ſtill they ought to reſerve ſome little Allegiance for him; yet when the Nation is generally under a new Oath, that little is become utterly impracticable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be ſafely diſmiſs'd.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Principles I have proceeded in complying with the new Oath (without extenuating the ſence of it, which is to render it ineffectual to the ſupport of the Government) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Proteſtation againſt the King-depoſing Doctrines and the reſt of the wild Fanatick Principles of the Age; not rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (ſo far as I know) from the ſound Doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants touching Duty to Government, nor from the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (which is no longer valuable then as ſhe retaineth her Virtue and Glory;) not conjuring up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain any evil ſpirits of the late times; not going to School to <hi>Mariana</hi> to learn Theology and Politicks; not pretending to ſwear Allegiance to any King <hi>de facto (quo jure quave inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>) to ſwear, unſwear and ſwear again as the times turn; not acknowledging Protection and Allegiance perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal, as if it was lawful and conſiſtent with virtue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the beſt of Princes when unable to protect us; which is an abandoning the due adherence to juſtice, and can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than the crime of abandoning our Sovereign Friend when he falleth into adverſity. God forbid that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſhould ever part with their ſound Doctrine and Principles (which no deliverance can compenſate the loſs of,) that the Conſciences of Men ſhould be debauch'd in matters of Morality and Virtue (which are far more valuable than States and Kingdoms;) or that the Oath, for want of clear Principles of Juſtice to proceed upon, ſhould be matter of ſcruple to any good Men, that are not prepar'd to ſwallow Camels.</p>
